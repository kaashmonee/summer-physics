# The Gaia Mission Notes
    * Gaia is *very good* at measuring distances

## Scientific Goals
    * Extremely precise data
    * Micro-arc second resolution

### Structure, dynamics, and evolution of the galaxy
    * Gaia distances -- allow determination of absolute luminosity
    * Gaia does this with parallax. It has a very large orbit, which 
    makes parallax a much more reasonble task, as opposed to using the 
    Earth's orbit around the sun.

### Binaries and multiple stars
    * Gaia - astrometric wobbling due to multiple star systems can be 
    detected
    * Periodic changes can be used to find eclipsing binaries

### Exoplanets
    * From whole spectrum of scientific topics that Gaia can address, the 
    exoplanet researhc area has been the most dynamic in the past two 
    decades
    * gaia does a great job looking for exoplanets and brown dwarfs

## The Local Group
    



# Data processing:
    * Very complex task, and can be split up into 2 parts:
        1. Daily
            * Produce preprocessed data that are needed by cyclic systems
            * Provide payload health monitoring
            * Determination of source parameters
        2. Cyclic
            * iterates between calibration and determination of source 
            parameters
            * Repeatedly processes all of Gaia data until system converges
                * What does it mean to converge?
# Important terms:
    * arc second: 
        * An arc second is 1/16th of arc minute, where an arc minute is 
        1/60th of an one degree
