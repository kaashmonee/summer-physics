# The Gaia Mission Notes
    * Gaia is *very good* at measuring distances

## Scientific Goals
    * Extremely precise data
    * Micro-arc second resolution

### Structure, dynamics, and evolution of the galaxy
    * Gaia distances -- allow determination of absolute luminosity
    * Gaia does this with parallax. It has a very large orbit, which 
    makes parallax a much more reasonble task, as opposed to using the 
    Earth's orbit around the sun.

### Binaries and multiple stars
    * Gaia - astrometric wobbling due to multiple star systems can be 
    detected
    * Periodic changes can be used to find eclipsing binaries

### Exoplanets
    * From whole spectrum of scientific topics that Gaia can address, the 
    exoplanet researhc area has been the most dynamic in the past two 
    decades


# Important terms:
    * arc second: 
        * An arc second is 1/16th of arc minute, where an arc minute is 
        1/60th of an one degree
